## 💡 Talking Points for Your Video

### Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hi everyone! I'm excited to share my machine learning project from my CodeAlpha internship. I built a disease prediction system that can predict heart disease with over 91% accuracy using patient medical data."

### Problem Statement (20 seconds)
"Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction can save lives. This system analyzes 13 medical features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and chest pain type to predict disease presence."

### Technical Approach (45 seconds)
"I implemented and compared four machine learning algorithms:
- Logistic Regression for baseline performance
- SVM for complex decision boundaries
- Random Forest for ensemble learning
- Gradient Boosting which achieved the best results

The data preprocessing included:
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Stratified train-test split

I evaluated all models using multiple metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC."

### Results (30 seconds)
"The Gradient Boosting model achieved the best performance with 91.8% accuracy. The model can identify 98% of actual disease cases, which is crucial in medical applications where missing a case could be fatal.

I also analyzed feature importance, finding that factors like chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, and number of major vessels are most predictive."

### Conclusion (15 seconds)
"This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in healthcare. Check out my GitHub repository for the complete code and documentation. Thank you!"
